# Singleton Design Pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single
point of access to it for any other code.

Singleton has almost the same pros and cons as global variables. Although they’re super-handy, they break the modularity
of your code.

You can’t just use a class that depends on a Singleton in some other context, without carrying over the Singleton to the
other context. Most of the time, this limitation comes up during the creation of unit tests.

## Example Use

A lot of developers consider the Singleton pattern an antipattern. That’s why its usage is on the decline in PHP code.

## Identification

Identification: Singleton can be recognized by a static creation method, which returns the same cached object.
